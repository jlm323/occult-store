## Description
The fictional Aether Emporium occult store was built with a primary focus on RESTful routing and creating a REST API using Node, Express, and MongoDB. 

The user can add new product items, edit existing product items, and delete items. Clicking the buy button on an item reduces the amount of the item in stock. If the item is no longer in stock, the user cannot buy it and will be shown the message, 'Out of Stock.'

## Built With
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React, MongoDB

## Future Implementation
- Shopping cart feature which shows what items have been added after clicking the buy button
- Ability to upload product images when creating a new product
